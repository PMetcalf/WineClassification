# WineClassification
Mini-machine learning project to classify wines (red or white) and predict wine quality using deep neural networks trained on wine property data.

For wine quality prediction, several model configurations are evaluated to determine the best algorithm. 

Training data is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning repository.
